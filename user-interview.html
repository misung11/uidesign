        <div class="question">7. What are the biggest challenges related to this interest or task?</div>
        <div class="answer">The Coupang gifting feature requires an extra click, and the contact search function is not very efficient. Also, it doesn't sync well with my saved delivery addresses.</div>

        <div class="answer">Using the gifting feature earns me reward points.</div>

        <div class="answer">I simply manually select the recipient and input the delivery address since the gifting feature doesn't work seamlessly.</div>

        <div class="question">13. What do you like or dislike about these other products or tools?</div>
        <div class="answer">Naver has a reasonable font size, and the gifting and purchasing buttons are prominent. However, adding items to the cart is prioritized, making it difficult to see what I've added.</div>
